class Camera:
    """
        redner supports a perspective camera and a fisheye camera.
        Both of them employ a look at transform.

        Note:
            Currently we assume all the camera variables are stored in CPU,
            no matter whether redner is operating under CPU or GPU mode.

        Args:
            position (length 3 float tensor): the origin of the camera
            look_at (length 3 float tensor): the point camera is looking at
            up (length 3 float tensor): the up vector of the camera
            fov (length 1 float tensor): the field of view of the camera in angle, 
                                         no effect if the camera is a fisheye camera
            fx (length 1 float tensor): focal length in x
            fy (length 1 float tensor): focal length in y
            ox (length 1 float tensor): optical center in x
            oy (length 1 float tensor): optical center in y
            clip_near (float): the near clipping plane of the camera, need to > 0
            resolution (length 2 tuple): the size of the output image in (width, height)
            fisheye (bool): whether the camera is a fisheye camera.
            pinhole (bool): whether camera uses a pinhole model
